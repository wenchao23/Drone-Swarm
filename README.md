# Drone swam simulation platform
The objective of this function is to provide a simulation platform in Python for drone swamming. This function is inspired by [Wil Selby](https://github.com/wilselby/MatlabQuadSimAP), for single drone coded in MATLAB.  

The simulations of distributed localization algorithm and  obstacle avoidance within Melbourne city using buildings data were later adopted into this function. 

# Demo

There are 8 drones in this demo. Their initial position are random and try to attain the desired positions via formation control and collision avoidance algorithm.
